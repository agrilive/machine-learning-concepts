### Trusted Data Sharing Framework

- Foundation of a vibrant Digital Economy

| Benefit to organizations  | Benefit to consumers |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Facilitates effective information exchanges  | Confidence in organization's ability to use and safeguard data  |
| Enables shared data assets to support the development of innovative solutions |   |

Trust principles

1. **Transparency** - openness in data sharing
2. **Accessibility** - ability to access data when parties need it
3. **Standardisation** - consistent legal and technical measures
4. **Fairness and ethics** - in the creation and use of data sharing systems and frameworks
5. **Accountability** - comply with data protection laws
6. **Security and data integrity** - securely protect and safeguard information

#### Part 1: Data sharing strategy

1. Establish data sharing potential and value of own data
  - Take stock of own data - data assets are 
    - identifiable and definable
    - promise probable future economic benefits
    - under the organization's control
  - Assess potential for sharing
    - consider all potential stakeholders
    - go beyond immediate key suppliers and consumers
  - Consider data valuation approaches
    - market approach e.g. traded prices, transactions of comparable data
    - cost approach e.g. cost of producing a replica
    - income approach e.g. revenue from data
    
 2. Understand potential data sharing models
 
| Models  | Risks |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| bilateral  | lack of control over the use of data  |
| multilateral  | lack of control over exchange or platform modifications  |
| decentralised e.g. peer-to-peer  |insolvency and reputational risks  |

3. Consider engaging data service provider to facilitate data sharing
  - To understand best practices
  - To assess potential costs
  - To mitigate risks
  
  
#### Part 2: Legal and regulatory considerations

1. Determine if data can be shared
  - Consider rules and restrictions on data
  - Data protection policies and practices
  - Considerations for sharing personal data
2. Establish data sharing agreement
  - Grant of the licence to use data for intended purpose
  - Restrictions to the permitted use of the data
  - Warranties provided
  - Allocation of liability
  - Confidentiality
  - Term/duration of agreement
  - Governing law and resolving disputes

#### Part 3: Technical and organization considerations

1. Prepare data for data sharing
2. Understand technical considerations for data sharing
 - Recommended practices for securing data sharing activities
   - Governance - licies, procedures and operational processes to maintain security over information
   - Infrastructure security - necessary security controls to prevent security breaches
   - Access management - measures to ensure that each user has only the minimum privileges for access to right resources
 - Possible technical delivery modes for data sharing
   - Wire/ removable storage media/ Wi-Fi etc.
 - Possible security measures to protect data integrity
   - Crypyography
   - Homomorphic encryption/ multi-party computation

#### Part 4: Operationalising data sharing

1. Ensure transparency and accountability
2. Monitor ongoing legal and regulatory obligations
3. Use of data for secondary purpose - Organizations may use data received for secondary purposes if agreed by parties
4. Understand considerations for retention and disposal of data - Organizations should retain/ dispose data received according to polices agreed between partners
